            <p>
              Dumbbells are well-known and are used either individually or in
              pairs. The handle is of either steel or iron, and the
              weights/weight plates are made of either steel, iron, rubber or
              cement. Dumbbells are usually adjustable. When compared to other
              gym equipment, dumbbells are considerably cheaper and can offer as
              much if not more than most equipment.
